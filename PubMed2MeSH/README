unique_pmids:
    The pubmed ids for which we want to get the mesh terms.
pmed2mesh:
    The pubmeds mapped to the ncbi mesh unique identifier (these ids start with 68)
pmed2mesh_nomesh:
    The pubmeds for which we could not fetch mesh_terms.
pmed2mesh_tr:
    The pubmeds mapped to the propper MeSH descriptor unique id (D012345)

To translate:
    awk '{for(i = 2; i <= NF; i++) gsub("^68","D",$i)}1' pmids2mesh > pmids2mesh_tr
